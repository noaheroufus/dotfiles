# dotfiles

This is a collection of my Linux/UNIX configuration files.

## Install

Installing this consists of symlinking all the files relative to `$HOME/`. You can easily do this by running the `link.sh` script included in the root directory of this repository. If the target destination already exists, then it will be backed up in the root directory of this repo.
